            <h2>Welcome to Casino-licious</h2>
                    <p><img src="images/chipscards.jpg" width="160" height="107" border="0" class="right">Welcome to casino-licious, the most deliciously entertaining online casino blog on the net! My name’s Randall and I’ve been an online casino aficionado for almost a decade, so like to think of myself as somewhat of an expert in the field. I’ll be guiding you through my choice picks of the best <a href="http://www.yukongoldcasino.eu" title="1 hour free casino">1 hour free casino</a> offers and the best places to <a href="http://www.goldentigercasino.com/roulette.asp" title="play roulette">play roulette</a> games, sorting the wheat from the chafe and skimming off the cream, so stick with me as we beat a path to those elusive jackpots.</p>
                
                    <p>When searching for my favourite things like <a href="http://www.casinoaction.de/roulette.asp" title="online casino roulette">online casino roulette</a>, one thing I’ve noticed about the <a href="http://www.virtualcitycasino.com" title="no deposit casino">no deposit casino</a> world, especially over the last 5 years, is the sheer growth in numbers of not only casinos but also casino affiliates trying their best to coax their site’s readership to click on their banners and contribute to their income! For example I came accross one <a href="http://www.casinoclassic.de" title="online casino">online casino</a> in Germany called Casino Classic. These guys were very good in the campaigning to reach customers.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.rewardsaffiliates.com" rel="nofollow">casino affiliates</a> usually do not have any interest in giving you the best information and are more focussed on earning money through commission through referrals. This means weighted opinions and biased reviews are the norm, with the affiliate willing to sell the story in any way to get the most clicks. One French <a href="http://fr.goldentigercasino.com" title="casino en ligne">casino en ligne</a> has been making strides in educating their affiliates to provide honest and useful information to their users. Their name is Golden Tiger Casino and they and they have actually been around for quite a number of years. Hot on the heels of these guys is Casino Action, a new <a href="http://www.casinoaction.fr" title="casino en ligne">casino en ligne</a> in France that is also available other languages.</p>
                    <p><strong>That’s where casino-licious is so refreshing!</strong> Whilst I won’t deny that I am too an affiliate, I have actually taken the time to review a helluva lot of casinos and games to bring you what is, in my opinion, the <a href="http://www.goldentigercasino.com" title="best online casino bonus">best online casino bonus</a> listing. In clicking and playing the games, sure, I might get a dollar or dime here or there, but more importantly for you, you will be getting the the best <a href="http://www.blackjackballroom.com/casino-games/" title="online blackjack game">online blackjack game</a>, roulette game and slots which will save you hours of searching and sifting through bogus opinions. So, without further ado, let’s start making some moolah!</p>
